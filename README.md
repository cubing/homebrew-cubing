# Homebrew Tap for Cubing

This [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) [tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) is meant to make it easy to install cubing software on macOS.

Example usage:

    # Make sure Homebrew is installed first:
    # https://brew.sh/

    brew tap cubing/cubing
    brew install cubing/cubing/twsearch

# Add more!

There is plenty of cubing software out there. If it's not in this tap yet, you can probably contribute a new program by copying and modifying an existing formula in this repository. Consult the Homebrew [formula cookbook](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Formula-Cookbook.md) for more advanced needs.

Also feel free to request a program by [filing an issue](https://github.com/cubing/homebrew-cubing/issues).
